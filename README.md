The purpose of the work was to develop an application in Java, 
which allows to perform selected algorithms for graphs without 
weights and their analysis. The graphs in the application are 
presented using adjacency matrix, incidence matrix and adjacency 
lists. The following algorithms were implemented in the work: 
vertex graph coloring, depth-first search and breadth-first 
search, edge graph coloring, square of graph, graph transposition
and determining a Hamilton cycle or path. Using the Swing library
created a graphical user interface. JUNG and JFreeChart libraries
were used to draw the graph and charts.
